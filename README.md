# password-phrase-gen
A Python script to generate random phrases for passwords

`MIN_WORD_LENGTH`, `MAX_WORD_LENGTH`, and `PHRASE_LENGTH` can be modified at the top of the script.

NOTE: After making this script, I found the `pip` package `xkcdpass`, which is the same thing but way better. Get it with `pip install xkcdpass`.
